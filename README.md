# Title: Starting intiial build of JPenny-fake-store-app
This is my end of mod 2 project. I have decided to create a web app that is going to contain most of features found on today's ecommerce sites.
for this project I will be using 3 API's:
- fake store API https://fakestoreapi.com/
- fake shop API https://www.fakeshop-api.com/
- Auth0 authentication API https://auth0.com/docs/api

## Hosted:
Netlify: https://frosty-tereshkova-a1594c.netlify.app/
## Objective:

purpose of this app is to test my abilities to create responsive web app using api that provides fake internet store data about products cart prices.
## Notes:
It is my understanding that some of the features should not be in front-end and I plan to move some of features to backend. Yet since one of the objective of this mod project was to build front-end only app I decided to create as many features that I could.
